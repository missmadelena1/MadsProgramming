Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
Project Two required me to create code that inputs and outputs user's interest rates based on monthly or no monthly deposits. I was to create a code that printed the monthly interest rate calaulations with and without monthly initial deposits from the user/customer. The user has to enter the value of their monthly deposit amounts and the code will calculate their interest rates off that number. 

What did you do particularly well?
What I did well in this project was taking my time in addressing the code as far as the print statement and the calculations went. 

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could have enhanced my code more by using more loops instead of repeating code; this way, it could have resulted in a cleaner code that is easier to follow.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I found the 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
All the data points in the code is transferrable to other projects and course work. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I always tested my code at almost every step. I first would write the code how I see fit, test and run the code and pay close attention to all the error messages. If there were error messages I could not fix, I went back into modules and ZYBooks exercises to replicate code to better understand which pieces of code would work and which would not.
