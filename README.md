Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
Project Two required me to create code that inputs and outputs user's interest rates based on monthly or no monthly deposits. I was to create a code that printed the monthly interest rate calaulations with and without monthly initial deposits from the user/customer. The user has to enter the value of their monthly deposit amounts and the code will calculate their interest rates off that number for the term at a fixed interest rate amount. 

What did you do particularly well?
What I did well in this project was taking my time in addressing the code as far as the print statement and the calculations went. The code worked perfectly for all the print statements and printed the user interface screen well.  

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could have enhanced my code more by using more loops instead of repeating code; this way, it could have resulted in a cleaner code that is easier to follow.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I found it challenging to write some of the calculation code. I found that some of my calculations were a bit off, or some of the spacing was off. These two resulted in me taking more time than I wanted to fix the code. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
All the data points in the code is transferrable to other projects and course work. I believe that the math and calculations portion would help significantly in the SDE environment I plan on going into.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this program maintainable, readable and adaptable by making sure that the end code was viable toward the Bank's user interface. I made sure that all the requirements were met and the code did not have any errors. Within the code, I made sure that it was easy to read with comments, maintinable within the comments as well if a future coder wanted to change any of the calculations, and adaptable so that the code is able to grow from  basic calculations. I always tested my code at almost every step. I first would write the code how I see fit, test and run the code and pay close attention to all the error messages. If there were error messages I could not fix, I went back into modules and ZYBooks exercises to replicate code to better understand which pieces of code would work and which would not.
